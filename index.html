<h2>what is JEE?</h2>
<p>The Joint Entrance Examination, commonly known as the JEE, is an All-India level examination for getting admission into the undergraduate level courses in the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs) and Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs). The JEE consists of two parts — JEE Main and JEE Advanced.</p>
<p>The JEE Main exam is for admissions into National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and Centrally Funded Technical Institutes (CFTIs). After writing JEE Main, if you clear the cut-off score for appearing in JEE Advanced, you’ll be eligible to appear for the same. JEE Main is conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE). Around 1.2 to 1.5 million candidates appear for the JEE Main every year.</p>

<p>The JEE Advanced exam is for admissions into the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). It is conducted by the IITs. The students who obtain marks greater than the JEE Main cut-off marks are eligible to appear in the JEE Advanced examination. In the year 2017, the top 220,000 examinees from JEE Main were eligible to sit for the JEE Advanced.</p>
<h2>Amazing Facts About the Joint Entrance Examination</h2>
<ol>

<li>The Joint Entrance Exam was not always called that. In its early days it was called Common Entrance Exam aka CEE.</li>

<li>Till 2005, the JEE was a mix of subjective and objective questions. It was revamped as a single objective-type test in 2006. Additional changes included were the class 12 marks criteria, whereby a general candidate had to score 60% and SC/ST/PwD had to score 55%.</li>

<li>Total number of colleges to accept JEE Main score stands at 1,101.</li>
<li>The number of women taking admission in the IITs through the Joint Entrance Exam dipped by 2% in 2016. This prompted the government to create supernumerary seats for girls. Supernumerary means seats apart from the existing ones therefore not hitting the general category boys.</li>
<li>Apart from the IITs, the following institutes also use the JEE Advanced ranks for admission into the B.Tech programs:
<ol>
<li>Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology, Rae Bareli (RGIPT)</li>
<li>Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST)</li>
<li>Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc)</li>
<li>Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy (IIPE), Visakhapatnam</li>
<li>Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>IISER Kolkata</li>
<li>IISER Bhopal</li>
<li>IISER Mohali</li>
<li>IISER Pune</li>
<li>IISER Berhampur</li>
<li>IISER Thiruvananthapuram</li>
<li>IISER Tirupati</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The current admission rate through the JEE has fallen from 1.95% in 2012 to 0.92% in 2017.</li>
<li>The whole pattern of engineering tests were dismantled and the new system of mains and advance came to being in 2013.</li>

NTA has also scraped out the weightage of class 12 marks for calculating All India Rank. From 2019 onwards, the engineering examination is being conducted twice a year in online (computer-based) mode.</p>



<h3>The key points about JEE Main Eligibility Criteria are as follows:</h3>
<ul>
<li>For B.E./ B.Tech (Paper 1) – Physics and Mathematics along with one of these subjects Chemistry/ Biology/ Biotechnology are mandatory in qualifying examination.</li>
<li>For B. Arch. (Paper 2) – Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics as compulsory subjects at 10+2 level and should also have secured above 50% marks in each subject.</li>
<li>For B. Planning (Paper 3) – Mathematics as a compulsory subject in class 12.</li>
